# youtube-browser
An app for searching and browsing youtube videos.

## Dependencies
* [Bootstrap v3.3.6](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Litebox-js](https://github.com/barretthafner/litebox-js)
* A YouTube API key

## Backstory
Built for a bootcamp exercise, this app searches the YouTube API based upon a simple search term.
I set out to do this task with the following requirements:

1. No jQuery
2. Display the videos in a lightbox
3. Keep my YouTube API key out of my repository

To complete requirements 1 and 2 together, I had to build a small lightweight lightbox library ([litebox-js](https://github.com/barretthafner/litebox-js)) that does not require jQuery.
